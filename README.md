**### The Scholastic Command Center: A React School Dashboard**

Greetings, academic trailblazer! Welcome to a repository where education meets elegance, and React orchestrates a symphony of dashboards and course views. 
This project is your one-stop cockpit for navigating the wilds of school life—think of it as the bridge of the Starship Academia, minus the warp drive (for now).
With a sleek sidebar, a commanding header, and views that toggle like a well-oiled lesson plan, 
this dashboard is here to make principals proud and students mildly jealous. Let’s get schooled in style!

**## What’s This Dashboard All About?**

This React app is a modular masterpiece designed to manage school-related chaos.
It features a sidebar for navigation, a header for gravitas, and interchangeable views—starting with a snazzy dashboard and a courses overview.
The code above is the beating heart of the app, stitching components together with the finesse of a valedictorian’s speech. 
It’s extensible, it’s elegant, and it’s ready to grow faster than a freshman on a cafeteria pizza binge.

**## The Class Roster**

Sidebar: Your trusty guide, steering you between views like a hall monitor with swagger.
Header: The top dog, keeping things official and omnipresent.
Dashboard: The default view—your mission control for all things school.
CoursesView: A peek at your academic lineup, because knowledge deserves a spotlight.
useNavigation: The custom hook that’s smarter than a straight-A student, managing view switches with ease.
## Getting Started: Enroll in the Code Academy

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (because React doesn’t run on chalkboards)
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox—no IE, we’re not *that* old-school)
- Basic React knowledge (or a willingness to fake it ‘til you make it)
- A love for clean UI and orderly data (mandatory)

### Installation

1. Clone this repo like it’s the last seat in a lecture hall:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trish004/school-dashboard.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd school-dashboard
   ```
3. Install dependencies faster than a teacher collecting homework:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Fire it up and watch the magic unfold:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage: Rule the School

- Launch the app and marvel at the sidebar’s navigation prowess—click “Dashboard” or “Courses” to switch views.
- Admire the responsive layout (Tailwind CSS, we presume?) that fits the screen like a perfectly tailored blazer.
- Extend it! Add views for grades, schedules, or a “detention tracker” (kidding… or am I?).

## Why This Exists

Because school deserves more than dusty binders and cryptic spreadsheets. This dashboard is perfect for students, teachers, or admins who want a digital HQ that’s as intuitive as a pop quiz is stressful.
It’s a foundation—build atop it, and soon you’ll be running the whole campus from your browser.

## Contributing: Join the Honor Roll

Just don’t plagiarize—Git tracks everything.

## License

MIT License—because education should be free(ish). Use it, tweak it, deploy it at your next PTA meeting.

## Final Bell

This project is your hall pass to a smarter, slicker school experience. So grab your React toolkit, channel your inner class president, and let’s make this dashboard the talk of the faculty lounge. 

**Happy coding, you academic architect!**
